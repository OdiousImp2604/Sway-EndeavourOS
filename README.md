## To-Do

- Maninly I want to work on the bar - everything else is working fine (I think)

Keybindings

Everything is the same as the i3, there is not yet a reference file (working on it)

One thing that changed : To launch wofi is is super+D , I recommend you look through the config for sway has some extra features which I added
